# 🤖 Intelligent FAQ Chatbot – Task 1

## 📌 Overview
The Intelligent FAQ Chatbot is a machine learning–based system developed to provide automated responses to frequently asked questions.  
It is trained on a structured Aadhaar FAQ dataset to ensure contextually accurate and relevant answers.

The project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess user queries, analyze intent, and retrieve the most appropriate response efficiently.

## 📂 Dataset Source
The chatbot model is trained using an Aadhaar FAQ dataset obtained from Kaggle:
[Aadhaar FAQ Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abbbhishekkk/faq-datasets-for-chatbot-training?select=Aadhar_Faq.txt)

## 🛠 Technical Implementation
The system integrates text preprocessing, vectorization, and classification techniques to enhance query matching performance.  
It is designed to deliver fast, reliable, and scalable responses suitable for real-world support systems.

## 🧰 Libraries & Tools
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning model building and classification  
- **NLTK** – Text preprocessing and NLP tasks  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **Pandas** – Data handling and analysis  
- **re (Regular Expressions)** – Data cleaning and pattern extraction  
- **NLPAug** – Text data augmentation
  
## 🚀 Project Goals
- Develop an automated FAQ response system  
- Implement NLP-based text processing  
- Improve answer retrieval accuracy  
- Reduce manual support dependency
